* How to deal with id of nodes?
  - Should it be equal over all versions of a pipe?
  - May ids be recreated on every save of the pipe, even in the same PHP request?

* Do we need a NodeList class with:
  - getById( $id )
  - count
  - isNodeinList( $node )
  Would be used as $inNodes, $outNodes of every node and as $pipe->nodes
