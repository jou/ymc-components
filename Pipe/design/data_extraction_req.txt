Introduction
============

Description
-----------

The component should provide an environment to define, execute, supervise and
debug chains of data extraction filters (also called wrappers).  The purpose is
to automatically retrieve predefined sets of data from large numbers of equally
structured web pages. Such web pages can be

* newsletter articles
* blog posts
* webshops
* social networks

Available Implementations
-------------------------

* Apache Cocoon: Seems to be overly complicated and to work only on well-formed
  XML and does not provide Regular Expressions.
* Web Harvester[1]: Small one-man Project on Sourceforge, java, BSD. Low level
  of code quality and reported performance issues in the forum. Last release
  oct07, only 27 revisions in SVN, very few documentation
* The Author of Web Harvester also wrote htmlCleaner[2], a project to transform
  erroneous html to XML.

Requirements
============

* Provide generic Filters to extract data with XPath, Regular Expressions, ...?
* A later version should include filters based on CSS-Selectors or
  CSS-Properties of HTML-Tags ("Take the largest text as Title")
* Filters can be chained to directed acyclic graphs (data extraction graphs)
* It must be possible to define filters to subtract some unwanted part out of
  the good text, e.g. advertising in an article text
* Provide generic Parsers working on input from filters and outputting
  structured data (DateTime, GeoCoordinates, Prices, Author names...)
* Provide verbose informations about failures in extraction to help on
  debugging by non-developers
* Do not silently ignore errors, but provide also notices and warnings about
  things that may be problems in the data extraction process.
* Provide an API for the definition, execution and debugging of data extraction
  graphs to build a GUI upon
* Provide an API for other components that persist data extraction graphs to
  files or databases

Design goals
============



Special considerations
======================

The following tasks are not to be done by this component:

* retrieving input informations from the internet. The data to work on should
  be retrieved independently by another component.
* Persisting the output data. This should be the task of the application using
  this component.
* Coordination of multiple instances of this component working in parallel.
  This should also be handled by the application in conjunction with the
  operation system.
